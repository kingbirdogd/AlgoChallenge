# Problem Description 
Remove k first or last items from any row of a M x N matrix, to find out the max sum of all removed items

# Problem Details
Write a function MaxSumOfRemovedKConnerItemsFromMatrixRow with 2 parameters
Parameter1 : M X N matrix, example: [[4, 2, 1, 7], [5, 3, 8, 9], [6, 1, 0, 2]], 3 Rows 4 Column table M = 3, N = 4

|4|2|1|7|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|5|3|8|9|
|6|1|0|2|

Parameter2 is a non-negative number k, where 0 <= k <= M x N
Here is an example k = 3;

What you need to do is, do k times operations.
For each operation, you need to do:

1. select any i, which 0 <= i < M, select a row in matrix which is row = matrix[i]
2. remove the first or the last item from the row you select. After removed, you can't remove this item again this time. The first or the last item for this row should be the adjacent item of the removed item
3. accumulate the removed item to the sum

The Function task is to find a best removed operations scenarios to make to sum to the max

# Condition:
Matrix size: M x N < 10000

and

matrix[i][j] >= 0

and

0 <= k <= M x N

# Example
matrix = [[4, 2, 1, 7], [5, 3, 8, 9], [6, 1, 0, 2]]
|4|2|1|7|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|5|3|8|9|
|6|1|0|2|

and

k = 3

the initialize sum = 0

the Best scenarios to do 3 operations isï¼š

# Operation 1: 
Remove the last item of row[1],

After this operation:
matrix = [[4, 2, 1, 7], [5, 3, 8], [6, 1, 0, 2]]
|4|2|1|7|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|5|3|8||
|6|1|0|2|

sum = 9

# Operation 2: 
Remove the last item of row[1],

After this operation:
matrix = [[4, 2, 1, 7], [5, 3], [6, 1, 0, 2]]
|4|2|1|7|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|5|3|||
|6|1|0|2|

sum = 9 + 8 = 17

# Operation 3: 
Remove the last item of row[0],

After this operation:
matrix = [[4, 2, 1], [5, 3], [6, 1, 0, 2]]
|4|2|1||
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|5|3|||
|6|1|0|2|

sum = 17 + 7 = 24

So the max sum is 24
